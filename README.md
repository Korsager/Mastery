# Mastery
Find your mastery

This prompt is designed to help you identify your purpose or inner calling, inspired by the work of Robert Greene.

Its goal is to offer you greater clarity and direction in life. The results are not absolute truths and should be taken with a grain of salt, but they can highlight useful insights and point you toward a meaningful path.

The true value lies not in the specific direction suggested, but in helping you set a course toward discovering and living your deeper purpose. More clarity and guidance can make it easier to move in the right direction.

The information used in this prompt may draw on ChatGPT’s memory feature and previous conversations. Like any software, ChatGPT is designed to improve engagement through algorithms that build a profile of you—this prompt leverages that information to better guide you.

At the beginning of the prompt, you are encouraged to provide additional details about yourself and your career. Doing so will improve the quality and relevance of the results.
